# Genre Gurus: Unraveling the Secrets Behind Oscar-Winning Movies and Their Directors

### **Intoduction**

The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. This project aims to visualize the diversity in the Academy Awards (Oscar awards) for the Best Director category. Due to the impossibility of obtaining a complete dataset of all winners and nominees from 1927 to 2023, one of the datasets from the Kaggle website was edited and curated with data about the genres of the nominees and winners.

### **Variables**

| Header | Description | Data Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| year | the year in which the movie has won or was nominated | integer |
| film | title of the nominated movie | string |
| genre | genre(s) of the film | string |
| director | name of the  nominee or winner | string |
| winner | True for winners, False for nominations only | boolean |

Special thanks to [Raphael Fontes](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award), who is the author of the basic dataset.

### **Inspiration**

This project aims to find out what were the most nominated and winning movie genres and count which directors won the most prizes. Moreover, it explores the possibility of whether is there any pattern or trend, that could make it possible to predict future Oscar Award Winners.
